//Use Arrow Functions to Write Concise Anonymous Functions

/*
We can make unnamed functions as inline functions like this.

const myFunc = function() {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}

With ES6 howerver we can achieve writing Anonymous functions with arrow functions like this.

const myFunc = () => {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}

Since that function above is only returning a vaue we can call the function like this instead.

const myFunc= () => "value"

It is simpler to do it this way.
